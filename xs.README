xs - just convert input byte stream to hex string

Examples:

% printf 'Example stream: \x7f\x99\x34' | ./xs

% ./xs ./xs
7f454c4601010100000000000000000002000300010000005083040834000000a0050000000000003400200006 ...

(...'s actually are not output of xs, but I'm showing that it's too much to fit here)
