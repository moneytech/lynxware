zdiv - compute dividors of a number

zdiv will compute all dividors for a number for you.
It's useful when you want to determine which block size is largest for a non-round file or
something like that. Or if you just want to test the number is not prime :)

Usage: zdiv max_dividor number_to_search

Example: zdiv 65536 412083 | tail -n1 # should give you 58869
