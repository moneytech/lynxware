minenv - clear environment, populate with dummy values then run program

minenv clears environment, populates it with these:

	HOME=/
	SHELL=/bin/sh
	UID=0
	USER=root
	PATH=/bin

then runs program specified with this environment.

This program does not have any meaning. For some reason I written it. I could use `env` better.

It's useful in init scripts though.
