Simple XOR scrambling tool.

Written in a hurry to test pseudoencrypton mode in Linux kernel.

Usage: xor padfile infile [outfile]

If outfile is given, output is written to outfile. If not, output is sent to stdout.
If one of files (padfile or infile) is shorter, then only these shorter number of
bytes will be processed, the rest of longer file is discarded.
