strl - calculate string length from command line or stdin

strl is like strlen() when called from shell.

It will accurately compute given command line, counting argv borders as spaces and omitting
not related argv elements (NULL and argv[0]). It will read stdin if there is no cmdline was given.
For each read string it will print a string length without newline.
