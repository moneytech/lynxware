mkrnd - generate random number

mkrnd takes two arguments: start and end, defining range from which random number is generated.
It can accept positive and negative 64 bit numbers.

mkrnd takes random numbers from /dev/urandom. If it can't open /dev/urandom, it will fall back
to gettimeofday() + random() approach.
