genuniq - unique random number set generator

genuniq generates a set of random numbers which will contain only unique numbers.
unique numbers maybe useful when shuffling a song list, rows in a document or
a list of people's names and telephone numbers. It also can generate a single
(unsigned) random number by specifying it's first parameter as 1.

This tool is useful for smaller sets of numbers (smaller than 1000). For bigger
sets the performance drops drastically, so do not abuse it.
