sigign - force ignore signals.

sigign prevents it's executee to receive some non critical signals which can be ignored: HUP, TERM, INT and others.
Note: you cannot ignore KILL and STOP (of course!), and you cannot ignore SEGV and other fatal signals on sane systems.

To ignore specific signal, you should run this program, specify numeric signal values to ignore
(see "kill -l"), one per each argv cell. For example, to ignore INT and TERM on Linux:

	sigign 2 15 cmdline ...
