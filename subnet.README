subnet - print exact subnet for address/prefix pair.

this is a simple tool akin to netaddr, which just zeroes out bits-n-bytes inside
binary address so that it will output a subnet that exactly matches subnet prefix.

example: 127.255.255.255/21 gives 127.255.248.0

The tool, like netaddr, works with IPv6 too.
