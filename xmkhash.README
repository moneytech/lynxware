xmkhash: X11 libc crypt(3) frontend.

xmkhash will ask you for a salt and password.
Then just give a result of crypt(3) over them.
No sanity checks performed.

xmkhash is written with XForms toolkit, and allows to resize a window
to see hashes which are usually very long enough to fit freely.

If crypt(3) will return an error, xmkhash will not indicate it.
It's a very simple program.
