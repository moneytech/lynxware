netaddr - test if given address is within subnet

netaddr takes two arguments: subnet, defined in CIDR form and address to test if it belongs to it.
Both v4 and v6 addresses are supported and parsed properly.

netaddr can take additional "-v" argument. In this case, it prints result in logic form.
Without it, it will return a status code easily parsed by shell.
