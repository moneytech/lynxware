rngdtiny - tiny rngd(8) replacement

rngd from rng-tools is bloated. This is much more lightweight replacement.

It was tested on android. It's static arm32 version with musl was 13k.

Now I don't use it. But I hope it can be used.

Usage:

Program accepts arguments:

-o dev: output random device
-r dev: source random device (must be more random than output)
-s num: byte block at a iteration
-W num: stop filling when more than num bytes available
-T delay: delay between reads in microseconds
