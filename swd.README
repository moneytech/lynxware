swd - chdirs into directory, then runs cmdline

swd just goes to specified directory and runs cmdline from there. Nothing complex.

swd is usually can be implemented with /bin/sh -c 'cd /dir; exec ...', but more simpler and not
dealing with quotes in shells. It also handy enough.

swd is implanted into my tools such as super as a separate option.

Without additional software, swd should be in every Unix system.
